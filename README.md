The technologies used in this portfolio include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flex. As I'm not an experienced web developer, to build this portfolio, google search and insepecting portfolios shared during Outcomes using Chrome Dev Tools as a basis for examples was my main strategy. The biggest hurdle was implmenting responsive design and taking time to test various emulation devices on console. The second biggest hurdle was implementing DRY for CSS code. It'll take some practice to understand how to create clean code when creating classes and ids in order to abouve redundancy- it was difficult to keep the class hierachy in mind without an outline. An unresolved issue that I did not have time to clean up was the responsive design of the tags that I created as well as cleaning up the logic for the pop-up to alert only once.
